## DataLink: OriginPro & MySQL

This LabTalk script is designed to facilitate data manipulation and
prediction tasks within the OriginPro software, specifically in the
context of machine learning and deep learning. It accomplishes the
following:

1.  **Data Export to MySQL**:

    - The script allows users to export experimental data from OriginPro
      to a MySQL database. Users can specify their data in designated
      columns, and the script inserts this data into a specified table
      in the database.

2.  **Data Import from MySQL**:

    - Users can also import data from a MySQL database back into
      OriginPro. This allows them to retrieve previously stored
      experimental results for further analysis or visualization.

3.  **Model Selection for Predictions**:

    - The script supports multiple machine learning models for making
      predictions based on user-selected parameters. These models
      include:

      - Linear Regression

      - Random Forest Regressor

      - Artificial Neural Network

      - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

      - Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

      - Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)

4.  **Predictive Analysis**:

    - After selecting a model, users can input parameters, and the
      script uses the selected model to predict outcomes based on these
      inputs. The predictions are generated using simple mathematical
      formulas that represent different machine learning models.

5.  **Model Loading**:

    - The script includes a placeholder function for loading
      user-defined models. This allows for future expansion where users
      can integrate their own trained models into the script for
      predictions.

6.  **User Interaction**:

    - The script features interactive buttons, making it user-friendly.
      Users can easily export data, import data, select models, and make
      predictions through a graphical interface.

**Use Cases**

- Researchers can use this script to streamline the process of managing
  experimental data and obtaining predictions based on different
  modeling approaches.

- It aids in quickly testing various machine learning models without
  needing extensive coding knowledge, making it accessible for users
  with varying levels of expertise.

Overall, this script enhances the functionality of OriginPro by
integrating data management with predictive modeling capabilities.

**Explanations:**

- **ExportToMySQL**: Exports data from OriginPro to the MySQL database.

- **ImportFromMySQL**: Imports data from the MySQL database to
  OriginPro.

- **PredictNextResult**: Makes predictions based on the selected deep
  learning model.

- **PredictResult**: Uses the selected model to predict results based on
  parameters.

- **SelectModel**: Allows the user to select a model for predictions.

- **LoadModel**: Placeholder for implementing user-defined model
  loading.

- **Buttons**: Creates buttons for exporting, importing, predicting,
  selecting models, and loading models.

**Notes:**

- Remember to update the username, password, and database name
  accordingly.

- Actual model loading and prediction functionality will require
  integration with appropriate libraries and methods.
